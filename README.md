## Array

### Merge Sorted Array ‚úÖ
(06/06/2023) <br/>
To solve the Merge Sorted Array problem, you can use the <strong>two-pointer </strong> approach. 
- Initialize two pointers, p1 and p2, to the last valid elements of nums1 and nums2 respectively.
- Set p as the index of the last element of nums1 (i.e., m + n - 1).
- Compare the elements at nums1[p1] and nums2[p2].
  - If nums1[p1] is greater than nums2[p2], set nums1[p] as nums1[p1], decrement p1 by 1, and decrement p by 1.
  - Otherwise, set nums1[p] as nums2[p2], decrement p2 by 1, and decrement p by 1.
- Repeat step 2 until p1 or p2 becomes less than 0.
- If there are any remaining elements in nums2 after the above steps, copy them to the beginning of nums1.

### Remove Element ‚úÖ
(06/07/2023) <br/>
You can solve this problem by using <strong>two pointers </strong>. 
- Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and the other at the end of the array.
- Iterate through the array with the first pointer, checking if the element at the current index is equal to the target element.
- If it is, swap the element with the element at the end of the array and decrement the end pointer.
- If it's not, increment the first pointer.
- Keep doing this until the first pointer crosses the end pointer.int

### Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array ‚úÖ 
(07/06/2023) <br/>
You can solve this problem using <strong> Sliding Window </strong>.
 - Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and the other next to it and a counter
- Iterate through the array with the first pointer, checking if the element at right index is equal or less than the left index.
  - If it is, increment the second pointer.
  - If it's not, replace the left + 1 index with the right index. Increment the cointer
- Keep doing this until the right pointer reaches the array length


### 169. Majority Element ‚úÖ 
(07/11/2023) <br/>
You can solve this problem using <strong> Hashmap </strong>.
- Check if array length is less than or equal to 2, return first element

(07/13/2023) <br/>
 ### Naive
- Initialize variables: Start by initializing two variables, minPrice and maxProfit, to track the minimum price and maximum profit encountered so far. Set minPrice to infinity and maxProfit to zero.

- Iterate through the prices: Iterate through the given array of prices, and for each price:

- Update minPrice: If the current price is smaller than minPrice, update minPrice to the current price.
- Calculate potential profit: Calculate the potential profit by subtracting minPrice from the current price.

  - else check if we have a value in the map that is equal to char T
    - this means that we already have the char mapped to something else, so return false
    - else add the char s key to char t value
- return true

### 242. Valid Anagram ‚úÖ 
(07/24/2023) <br/>
- Check if the two string's lengths are equal, if not return false
- Create a new map
- Loop through s and create a key value pair in the map of each occurance of the char
- Loop through t and check if there is a key in the map for t char
  - if there is decreament it, check if the new value is less than 0, if yes return false
  - if not return false
- reurn true

### 1. Two Sum  ‚úÖ 
(07/26/2023) <br/>
- Create a new map
- loop through the array
  - if map does not have the element as key, add the target - element as the key and its index as the value
  - check if there is an element in the map which has a different index value
  - if it does then return the array of the index and the map's key value
 
  ### 290. Word Pattern  ‚úÖ 
(07/27/2023) <br/>
- Create a new maps
- Split the string into an array of words
- loop through the words
  - Populate map1 with char as key and word as value if key not present in map1
  - Populate map2 with word as key and char as value if key not present in map2
  - If value is present return false accordingly
- return true

### Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II ‚òë
(07/10/2023) <br/>
You can solve this problem using <strong> two pointers </strong>.
 - Initialize two pointers, both starting at the second element i.e. index 1
   - first pointer keep tracks of non-duplicate elements
   - second pointer keep tracks of duplicate elements 
- Iterate through the array with starting from the second element to the array's last element.
  - Check if the previous elements is equal the the current index's element
    - If it is then move the duplicate check pointer
    - If it is not then move the duplicate pointer element to 1 to indicate that this is a non duplicate element
  - Check if duplicate element pointer is less than or equal to 2
    - If it is then swap the current pointer element with the iterated element
- Return the pointer that is keeping track of the duplicate elements


### 189. Rotate Array ‚òë
(07/12/2023) <br/>
You can solve this problem using <strong> two pointers </strong>.
- Determine the number of rotations: Decide how many times you want to rotate the array and store it in a variable, let's say "k".

- Handle special cases: Check if "k" is greater than the length of the array or if "k" is a negative number. In such cases, you can adjust the value of "k" to bring it within the valid range. For example, if "k" is greater than the array length, you can take the modulus of "k" with the array length to get the effective number of rotations.

- Reverse the entire array: Start by reversing the entire array. You can swap the elements from the start and end of the array, gradually moving towards the middle until you reach the middle element. This step ensures that the elements that need to be at the front after rotation will end up at the back, and vice versa.

- Reverse the first "k" elements: Reverse the first "k" elements of the array. This can be done by swapping the elements from the start and end, moving towards the middle until you reach the "k/2" element. This step brings the desired "k" elements to the front of the array.

- Reverse the remaining elements: Reverse the remaining elements of the array, excluding the first "k" elements. This can be done by swapping the elements from the start and end, gradually moving towards the middle until you reach the middle of the remaining elements. This step ensures that the remaining elements are brought back to their original order.

- Print or return the rotated array: Finally, you can print the rotated array or return it from the function, depending on your requirements.

### 189. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks II ‚òë
(07/19/2023) <br/>
Instead of trying to find the exact buying and selling points, <strong> focus on identifying the increasing sequences of prices </strong>. The maximum profit can be obtained by simply buying at the beginning of each increasing sequence and selling at the end of it

- initialize the maxProfit variable
- loop through the array
   - if the price is increasing compared to previous day
     - then update the maxProfit by adding the difference between the present day and previous day
 - return the final profit
